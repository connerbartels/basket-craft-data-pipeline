This project implements a complete ELT pipeline for website_sessions data from December 2023. The data is extracted from a MySQL source using Python and SQLAlchemy, then loaded into a Postgres raw schema. Using dbt, the data is transformed through staging and warehouse models into a daily session summary with UTM source attribution. The pipeline is automated using GitHub Actions and Secrets, and results are visualized in an interactive Looker Studio dashboard. This project mirrors real-world data workflows and incorporates lesson content from class exercises and this take-home quiz.
